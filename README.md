# Hydrostatic pressure as a predictor of star formation in nearby galaxies

The objective of this project is to several data analysis methods used in my study of the relation between the hydrostatic pressure and star formation rate density on local scales in galaxies observed as part of the ACA-EDGE survey, where I compare said relation to the ones previously established between the stellar mass density, molecular gas mass density, and star formation rate density. The csv files contain the data used, which can be merged together into a single database using the `Source_id` column, and the Jupyter noteboook showcases the analysis, including a
